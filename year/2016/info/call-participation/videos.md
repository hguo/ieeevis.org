Please read the following instructions carefully and submit your 25-second Fast Forward and Video Preview by August 1, 2017.

At least one author for each accepted submission is required to present a 25-second preview of their work during a Fast Forward (FF) session.  A 25-second video should be submitted to support this live presentation.  These videos will also be accessible from the conference website on the VIS Vimeo channel prior to the conference.
